    <h2>Israel - Singer Songwriter</h2>
    <img src="images/israel2.jpg" alt="Israel" class="responsive">
    <p>Born in Hackney, London in 1972, I grew up with a troubled background, without a father figure and in the care system. After leaving care, I ended up going down the wrong paths in life.</p>
    <p>I started attending college and university, but the Bible, faith, and Jesus were the furthest things from my mind. Rastafarian ideology and idolising Bob Marley were a big part of my identity. In fact, it was idolatry.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, a preacher approached me and began telling me about Jesus. A few years later, a married couple also shared Jesus with me. Soon after, I took a step of faith, put my trust in Jesus, repented of my sins, and believed in Jesus Christ, God's only Son.</p>
